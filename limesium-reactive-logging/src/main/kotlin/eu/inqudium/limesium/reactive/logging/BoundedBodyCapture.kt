/**
 * A bounded tee target: the capturing decorators copy every body byte that actually flows through the
 * exchange into this buffer, up to [maxBytes]; beyond the cap bytes are only counted.
 *
 * The capture is a passive copy of the live stream - it never buffers, replays, or withholds bytes - so
 * unlike a replaying body cache there is no `IN_PROGRESS`/`COMPLETE` lifecycle to manage: at the moment
 * the exchange line is written, whatever has flowed is what gets logged.
 *
 * ## Concurrency model - frozen at emission
 *
 * The reactive stack does NOT guarantee that body delivery has ended when the exchange is emitted: a
 * CANCEL (client disconnect) runs `doFinally` immediately, while Reactive Streams still permits an
 * already-requested `onNext` to arrive on another thread afterwards. The capture therefore guards
 * itself instead of relying on a single-writer assumption: every mutation and every read runs under
 * one uncontended [ReentrantLock], and the emitter calls [freeze] FIRST - from then on the capture is
 * immutable, a late tee call is a no-op, and the logged body and the size sample are one consistent
 * snapshot instead of a moving target (finding 1 of an internal code analysis).
 *
 * With `maxBytes = 0` the capture runs in COUNT-ONLY mode: nothing is buffered, [totalBytes] still
 * counts every byte - the mode the body-size metrics use when body logging is off. The tee is fed from
 * mapped `DataBuffer`s (see [CapturingResponseDecorator]).
 *
 * Besides the bytes, the capture records HOW FAR the application consumed the body ([readState]): the
 * tee mirrors consumption, not transmission, so a body the application never subscribed to - or
 * cancelled half-way - is invisible in the byte count alone. The request tee marks the subscription
 * and the completion signal; the emitter turns the state into the `endpoint.request.body.read` counter.
 * Like every other mutation, the marks are no-ops once frozen: the state is part of the emission
 * snapshot.
