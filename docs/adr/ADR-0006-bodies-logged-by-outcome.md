# ADR-0006: Body logging is a mode per direction, gated by the outcome

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-09-03  
**Deciders:** Dirk Haase (maintainer)  
**Related:** ADR-0003 (`BodyLogMode` lives in `limesium-common` by
its criterion), ADR-0005 (the companion configuration break of the
same release)

## Context

`log-request-body` / `log-response-body` were booleans: `true` meant
every body of every exchange. That is the switch that decides the log
VOLUME, and it had only two positions: off, or everything.

What is nearly always wanted in practice is "bodies only when
something went wrong": that reduces the volume by orders of magnitude
and hits exactly the exchanges a body is wanted for. The structure for
it already existed (the outcome is final before the line is written);
only the third position was missing.

The catch is the request body: it flows before the outcome is known,
so it has to be captured and, in the common case, thrown away. That
costs the capture but saves the output, and the output is what burdens
the log pipeline (ELK, the shippers, the indices).

## Decision

**Each body direction has a mode, `never` | `on-failure` | `always`,
not a switch.**

| Mode         | Captures                                           | Writes the body to the line                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `never`      | nothing for logging (a size meter may still install a count-only capture, as before) | never                    |
| `on-failure` | on every exchange, bounded by `max-body-bytes`     | only when the exchange failed (gate below)   |
| `always`     | on every exchange, bounded by `max-body-bytes`     | always (the former `true`)                   |

`never` is the default.

**The gate.** `on-failure` writes the bodies when `endpoint_outcome`
is not `success` (`failure`, `timeout`, and on the reactive twin
`cancelled`), or when the status is a 4xx. The emitter decides when
the outcome is final; the request side captures ahead and discards.
The gate is wider than the outcome vocabulary by exactly one status
class: a 4xx response keeps its `success` outcome (the application
answered; the client's request was wrong), so levels, metrics and
dashboards are untouched, but its bodies are logged, because a
client's error is exactly the case a body explains. A 5xx is a
`failure` and logs as well. A slow but healthy exchange stays
`success` and logs no bodies.

**Binding.** The former booleans are refused at binding time (`true`
is not a mode name): an operator who believed body logging on must see
the migration at startup, not discover a silent `never` in production.

**Scope:** the mode lives in the shared core (`BodyLogMode`), so both
twins and the sibling project legatium, where the mode was designed in
first and whose namespace mirrors this one, gate the same way.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Body logging becomes affordable outside a debug session:
  `on-failure` logs the bodies that explain an incident and nothing
  else.
- A misconfigured `true` fails loudly at startup instead of silently
  logging nothing.

**Negative:**

- `on-failure` costs the request-body capture on every exchange
  (memory up to `max-body-bytes` per in-flight exchange, and on the
  reactive twin the tee's transient copy per buffer), whether or not
  the line ends up with a body.
- **Breaking configuration and source change:** `true` / `false`
  become `always` / `never`; the properties' type changes from
  `Boolean` to `BodyLogMode`. The reference configurations, the
  lockstep tests and both twins' guides carry the new vocabulary.

**Neutral:**

- `measure-*-body-size` is unchanged: it still measures what flowed, in
  every mode.
- A 4xx is logged like a failure for bodies only; its outcome, level
  and metrics stay those of a `success`.

## History

- **2026-09-03 (PR #50):** modes introduced; the first cut followed
  the outcome vocabulary strictly and withheld 4xx bodies.
- **2026-09-03 (PR #51):** the gate widened to 4xx responses. The
  strict version hid validation errors, the bodies most often wanted.
