# ADR-0006: Body logging is a mode per direction, gated by the outcome

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09-03
- **Context:** `log-request-body` / `log-response-body` were booleans:
  `true` meant every body of every exchange. That is the switch that
  decides the log VOLUME, and it had only two positions - off, or
  everything. What is nearly always wanted in practice is "bodies only when
  something went wrong": that reduces the volume by orders of magnitude and
  hits exactly the exchanges a body is wanted for. The structure for it
  already existed - the outcome is final before the line is written - only
  the third position was missing. The catch is the request body: it flows
  before the outcome is known, so it has to be captured and, in the common
  case, thrown away. That costs the capture but saves the output, and the
  output is what burdens the log pipeline (ELK, the shippers, the indices).

## Decision

**Each body direction has a mode, `never` | `on-failure` | `always`, not a
switch:**

1. `never` (the default) captures nothing for logging. A size meter may
   still install a count-only capture, exactly as before.
2. `on-failure` captures the body on every exchange - bounded by
   `max-body-bytes`, like `always` - and writes it to the line only when
   `endpoint_outcome` is not `success`: `failure`, `timeout`, and on the
   reactive twin `cancelled`. The emitter decides when the outcome is
   final; the request side captures ahead and discards.
3. `always` captures and logs on every exchange - the former `true`.
4. The gate follows the outcome vocabulary, not the status class: a 4xx
   response is a `success` outcome (the application answered; the client's
   request was wrong) and logs no bodies; a 5xx is a `failure` and does. A
   slow but healthy exchange stays `success`. Changing what counts as a
   failure is a change of the vocabulary, not of this mode.
5. The former booleans are refused at binding time (`true` is not a mode
   name): an operator who believed body logging on must see the migration
   at startup, not discover a silent `never` in production.

The mode lives in the shared core (`BodyLogMode`), so both twins and the
sibling project legatium, where the mode was designed in first and whose
namespace mirrors this one, gate the same way.

## Consequences

- Body logging becomes affordable outside a debug session:
  `on-failure` logs the bodies that explain an incident and nothing else.
- `on-failure` costs the request-body capture on every exchange (memory up
  to `max-body-bytes` per in-flight exchange, and on the reactive twin the
  tee's transient copy per buffer), whether or not the line ends up with a
  body. `measure-*-body-size` is unchanged: it still measures what flowed,
  in every mode.
- Breaking configuration and source change: `true` / `false` become
  `always` / `never`; the properties' type changes from `Boolean` to
  `BodyLogMode`. The reference configurations, the lockstep tests and both
  twins' guides carry the new vocabulary.
