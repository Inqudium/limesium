/**
 * Runs the diagnostics of a fail-open catch handler - the fail-open counter increment and the internal
 * log line - so that a failure of the DIAGNOSTICS channel itself can never escape into the request.
 *
 * Every catch block in the twins reports through a Micrometer counter and an SLF4J logger; both run
 * against host-provided components (a throwing `Counter` implementation, a global throwing
 * appender/TurboFilter that also covers the internal logger). Unguarded, such a throw would leave the
 * catch handler and fail request assembly or disturb the response commit - the one outcome the fail-open
 * contract forbids. There is nothing left to report
 * to when the reporting channel is broken, so the secondary failure is deliberately dropped.

/**
 * The FULLY-CONFINING fail-open guard shape the emitters and callbacks share: [operation] runs; an
 * [InterruptedException] first restores the thread's interrupt flag (the JVM cleared it when it threw,
 * and on a request-serving or event-loop thread the interrupt must still reach its addressee), then -
 * like every other [Exception] - the failure goes to its handler, itself wrapped in [reportQuietly] so
 * a broken diagnostics channel cannot escape either. Nothing is rethrown and nothing runs after a
 * failure.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT used by guards with richer semantics - a rethrow of the original exception (the
 * filters' chain calls), a produced value (fail-open wiring), or work that must still happen after a
 * confined failure (`ExchangeLifecycle.onTerminal` completes the exchange) - those keep their explicit
 * try/catch, where the deviation is visible.
