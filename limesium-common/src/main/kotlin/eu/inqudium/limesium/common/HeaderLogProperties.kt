/**
 * One header section (`request-headers` / `response-headers`): which header names are logged, and which
 * of the logged values appear in plaintext. Shared by both endpoint-logging twins (ADR-0003 amendment):
 * selection semantics are a cross-twin contract, and THIS KDoc is its normative text - the reference
 * YAML names the keys and defaults and points here (CONTRIBUTING, "one normative source").
 *
 * MASKED BY DEFAULT (ADR-0005): a logged header's value is replaced by the [HeaderValueMasker]'s
 * rendering unless its name is explicitly allowed in plaintext. The two lists that widen the selection
 * and the one list that removes masking are therefore never coupled the wrong way round: an
 * `includes: ["*"]` typed for a debugging session costs readability, not confidentiality.
 *
 * - [includes] names the headers to log; empty means NONE (the safe default). The entry `*` includes
 *   every header the message carries.
 * - [excludes] removes names from the included set - meaningful mainly together with the `*` include;
 *   an exclude always wins over an include. A `*` here is rejected by `init` (binding time) - an empty
 *   [includes] already logs nothing, so a wildcard exclude could only be a misconfiguration that would
 *   otherwise fail silently.
 * - [masked] names the logged headers whose VALUE is replaced by the masker's rendering; the default
 *   `["*"]` masks every logged header. Narrowing it to explicit names is possible but rarely what is
 *   wanted - prefer [unmasked]. An empty list switches masking off wholesale: an explicit, visible
 *   decision, never the accidental result of another list.
 * - [unmasked] names the logged headers that appear in PLAINTEXT although [masked] covers them - the
 *   allowlist of harmless names (`Content-Type`, `Accept`, a correlation id). An unmasked name always
 *   wins over a masked one. A `*` here is rejected by `init`: the plaintext set is an explicit list of
 *   names by design; to log everything in plaintext, empty [masked] instead.
 *
 * Masking (and unmasking) only affects headers that are logged at all - listing a name in [masked] or
 * [unmasked] does not include it. All matching is case-insensitive, as header names are.
