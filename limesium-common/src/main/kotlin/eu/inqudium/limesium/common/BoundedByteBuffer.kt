/**
 * The byte-bounded buffer beneath both twins' `BoundedBodyCapture` (ADR-0003): keeps the first [maxBytes]
 * bytes written to it and renders them as the logged body text. NOT thread-safe - each twin guards it by
 * its own concurrency design (volatile single-writer on the servlet stack, lock and freeze on the
 * reactive one), and counting the bytes that flowed, including those beyond the cap, is the twin's
 * business too: the total comes back in for [render].
 *
 * A bare array rather than a `ByteArrayOutputStream`: the servlet twin discards the capture with a
 * reset of an uncommitted response, so the buffer must be able to CUT BACK ([truncate]), and the array
 * is sized once by the length the peer or the application declared ([expect]), so a body within its
 * declaration lands in one allocation without growth. Allocated on the first buffered byte - a buffer
 * nothing is written to (count-only mode, a body never read) costs no memory. Beyond the hint the array
 * doubles, never past [maxBytes].
