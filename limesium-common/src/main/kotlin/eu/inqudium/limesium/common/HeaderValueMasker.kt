/**
 * Redacts the VALUE of a header listed in a section's [HeaderLogProperties.masked] before it reaches the
 * log line. Injectable for the same reason as [NanoTimeSource] and [CorrelationIdGenerator]: the
 * fingerprint's shape is a policy the host may own - a keyed HMAC for a compliance regime that forbids
 * unkeyed hashes, a fixed `***` for a host that wants no correlation at all - and both twins take the
 * bean through their auto-configuration (`@ConditionalOnMissingBean`), so one host bean masks the
 * servlet line and the reactive line alike.
 *
 * The contract is the same as the built-in default's: the returned string replaces the value on the
 * line and MUST NOT contain the plaintext. Whether it is stable (equal values, equal output) is the
 * implementation's choice - stability is what makes a masked token correlatable across events; a host
 * that trades it away does so knowingly.

         * both twin modules, and the same scheme the sibling project legatium uses on the outbound side,
         * so a masked token correlates across the server line and the client line. STABLE: identical
         * values render identically, so a masked token can still be correlated across events and modules
         * without exposing the secret itself; a 64-bit cryptographic prefix makes accidental collisions
         * negligible (the former 32-bit `String.hashCode` fingerprint collided trivially).
         *
         * Privacy model: the fingerprint is unsalted and unkeyed - it prevents PLAINTEXT exposure, not
         * offline guessing. A log reader with a candidate list (low-entropy values: usernames, tenant
         * names, short API keys) can confirm a candidate by hashing it. Do not treat `masked` as a
         * security boundary for guessable values; omit such headers from the selection instead - or
         * pin a keyed masker bean.
