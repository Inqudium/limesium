/**
 * Redacts the VALUE of a logged header - every one, by default (ADR-0005), unless a section's
 * [HeaderLogProperties.unmasked] allows the name in plaintext - before it reaches the log line. The
 * rendering is a stable PSEUDONYM, not anonymisation: equal values stay recognisable as equal, which is
 * the point (correlation) and the limit (a keyed masker is what stops a reader from confirming a guess). Injectable for the same reason as [NanoTimeSource] and [CorrelationIdGenerator]: the
 * fingerprint's shape is a policy the host may own - a keyed HMAC for a compliance regime that forbids
 * unkeyed hashes, a fixed `***` for a host that wants no correlation at all - and both twins take the
 * bean through their auto-configuration (`@ConditionalOnMissingBean`), so one host bean masks the
 * servlet line and the reactive line alike.
 *
 * Two built-ins cover the common cases without a bean of the host's own: [DEFAULT], the unkeyed
 * fingerprint, and [keyed], the same fingerprint over an HMAC - which is what the `masking-key`
 * property selects ([forKey]). A host with a stricter policy still pins its own bean.
 *
 * The contract is the same as the built-in default's: the returned string replaces the value on the
 * line and MUST NOT contain the plaintext. Whether it is stable (equal values, equal output) is the
 * implementation's choice - stability is what makes a masked token correlatable across events; a host
 * that trades it away does so knowingly.
